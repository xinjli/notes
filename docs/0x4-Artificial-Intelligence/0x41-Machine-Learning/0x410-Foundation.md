Machine Learning is to find a function

$$f: X \to Y$$

The task of machine learning can be roughly classified into following groups
- When $Y$ is a float scalar, it is called a regression task
- When $Y$ is an integer scalar, it is called the classification task
- When it is a more complex structure, it is called the structured learning.
