# 0x451 Phonology

## Basic
natural class: a set of phonemes in a specific language that shares some features (e.g: articulatory features). For example, /p/ has features [-voice, +bilabial, +stop], and /k/ has [-voice, +velar, +stop], and they are in the same natural class

phonotactics: permissible combinations of phonemes in a language

viseme: a set of phonemes which look the same visually (e.g: /k,g/). Mainly used for lip-reading

## English
aspirated consonants and its non-aspirated counterparts are same phoneme (e.g: [t], [t^h] are allophones for /t/)

## Mandarin Chinese
be careful about the pinyin assignment and the phoneme assignment

phoneme音标和威妥玛拼音更相近，[b]等浊音为吴语保留了

|拼音	|phone |
