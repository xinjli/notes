# 0x452 Orthography

An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language. It includes norms of spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation.

## Writing Systems

A grapheme is the smallest functional unit in a writing system, broadly speaking, it can represent three different levels of linguistic information: individual sounds (alphabet), syllables (syllabary) or words (logographic systems).

### Logographic systems



### Syllabic systems: syllabary
In a **syllabary** writing system, there is a different symbol for each syllable. For example, Devanagari.


### Segmental systems: alphabets
An **alphabet** is a small set of letters (basic written symbols), each of which roughly represents or represented historically a segmental phoneme of a spoken language

**Abjad** Abjad is a group of alphabet writing system in which there is only one symbol per consonant: vowels are not usually marked. Many Semitic languages are written with Abjads, including Arabic and Hebrew.
