# Technical Notes

## Introduction

This website contains my technical notes in different academic domains. I have been keeping updating these notes from 2017,  I find it easier for me to learn and remember some new concepts when I summarized in this style. I share notes here in case it might be useful for other people.

Many of them are typically organized to follow the structures of textbooks in each domain, but I have re-organized many structures so that it makes more sense to me. All notes here are roughly indexed from theoretical topics to practical topics (abstract to concrete). It starts from the most foundamental ZF(C) axioms to the "most" practical topics of speech recognition (which is my research focus).
