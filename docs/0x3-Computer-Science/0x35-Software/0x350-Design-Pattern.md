## 1. Foundations

### 1.1. Basic Concepts

**SOLID**

*   S: Single-responsiblity principle.
*   O: Open-closed principle.
*   L: Liskov substitution principle.
*   I: Interface segregation principle.
*   D: Dependency Inversion Principle

Composition vs Aggregation

Both are Association

*   Composition: A "owns" B
*   Aggregation: A "uses" B

## 2. Catalogs

#### 2.0.1. Facade

*   hide complex logic by providing an clean interface (just a wrapper?)

#### 2.0.2. Iterator

*   Iterator provides a way to access an aggregate object without exposing internal representations
*   Each Iterator is responsible to maintain the current element
*   Each iterator is associated with its aggregate, so aggregate object should implement Aggregate (Iterable) interface which supports the createIterator
