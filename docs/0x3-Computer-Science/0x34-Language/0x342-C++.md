# 0x342 C++

## Abstraction
## Standard Library
### Concurrency
std::thread: it needs to join or detach. use RAII to make sure it will be handled correctly.
std::mutex: RAII with std::lock_guard or std::unique_lock(can lock multiple mutex and unlock)
std::recursive_mutex: allow a thread to acquire a mutex multiple times without deadlock

### STL Container
not thread-safe

### Algorithm
sort: looks optimized using different sort (insertion <-> quick) when length is short or long
Standardization
## C++11 (C++0x)
lambda expression
## C++14
## C++17
## C++20
Generic Programming: 

concept, constraint

## C++23 ?!
