## 1. Foundation
SQL language is divided into several distinct parts:
- schema statements: define the data structure in the database (e.g: create table)
- data statement: manipulate the data structures (e.g: insert)
- transaction statement: begin, end and roll back transactions

## 2. Data Types

### 2.1. Numeric
In mysql, we have following types, each type can be signed or unsigned

Integers
- tinyint (1 byte)
- smallint (2 byte)
- mediumint (3 byte)
- int (4 byte)
- bigint (8 byte)

Floating point numbers:
- float(p, s)
- double(p, s)

### 2.2. String
Character data can be stored as either fixed-length `CHAR` or variable-length strings `VARCHAR`.

The character set can be choosed, utf-8 is the default encoding in MySQL.

Note the max length is different across different SQL implementations.

- **char**: right-padded, will consume fixed space, up to 255 bytes in MySQL
- **varchar**: not padded, will not consume fixed space, up to 65535 bytes in MySQL (originally 255), it will store 1,2 bytes prefix to indicate the length
- **text**: up to 65535 in MySQL

#### 2.2.1. String functions

Note that different SQL implements different API with similar features, here we list the MySQL's APIs.

- char: int to char
- ascii: char to int
- length: length
- concat: concatenation
- strcmp: comparison
- position: find
- locate: find from an offset
- substring: substring
- insert: insertion


### 2.3. Temporal

In MySQL,

- date: YYYY-MM-DD
- datetime: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS (1000 ~ 9999)
- timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS (1970-01-01 ~ 2038-01-18)
- year: YYYY
- time: HHH:MI:SS

## 3. Operators

### 3.1. Conditions Operators
Conditions is used to filter out unwanted data, these can be combined using operators such as not, or, and, parenthesis.

- equality condition (e.g: =)
- inequality conditioin (e.g: <> or !=)
- comparision and range condition(e.g: <, >, between and)
- membership condition: (e.g: in (A, B, C))
- matching condition: (e.g: _, % wildcards and reg exp)
- null condition: (e.g: is null, is not null)

### 3.2. Set Operators
Set operators takes more than 2 tables as their operands.

The following guidelines must apply when performing set operations on two data sets:
- Both data sets must have the same number of columns
- The data types of each column must agree

These are all sepcified by ANSI SQL, but MySQL did not implement intersect and except.

Operators:
- union, union all: the former removes the duplicates, the later does not
- intersect: intersection
- except: not


## 4. Select
Roughly, the flow to execute a select is as follows:
- server checks the permission and syntax of the statement
- query is handed to the query optimizer to determine the most efficient way to execute
- optimizer picks up an execution plan, which the server uses to execute your query

Several components or caluses make up the *select* statement

- **select**: determines columns
- **from** identifies the table from which to retrieve data
- **where**: determines rows (filter out unwanted rows)
- **group by**: used to group rows together by common column values
- **having**: filter out unwanted groups
- **order by**: sorts the rows of the final result set by one or more columns (ascent by default)
