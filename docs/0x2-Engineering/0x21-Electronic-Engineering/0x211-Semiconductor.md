# 0x211 Semiconductor

Electrical conductivity of Semiconductor is between medal and insulator 

Properties

- amplification
- switch
- energy transformation

Material
- Group 14: Silicon, Germanium

Band
- **Conduction band**: electrons distributed here for medals
- **Valence band**: electrons distributed here for insulators

**Doping**
- N type: redundent electron
- P type: electron hole

## Diode
p-n junction

forward bias: electron moves when voltage > 0.7V 
reverse bias: reverse voltage will widen energy of depletion layer
